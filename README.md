## My Library: (Slideshow: Figure and Presentation Tools)
In this exploration, I played with a library that creates slideshows. Cool library and super easy to learn!

If you want to test it out you'll need this include line.
```
#lang slideshow
```

I started my explorartion by creating a simple slide with a title.
```
(slide
 #:title "Hello World")
 ```
You can create any number of slides so that when you run your program, you can easily browse through them with the arrow-keys. You also have the option of specifying certain attributes using #: followed by a keyword and your specification. This includes stuff like the slide's layout, gap-size, timeout, etc.

The next thing I experimented with was body-text. After you speficy the slide's characteristics, you can add text in two different ways.
```
(t string)

(item string)
```
The first displays text using the default font and style. The second method creates a bulleted paragraph that spans (by default) the middle 2/3 of the slide.

If you want the option to display your body-text in sequence, include *'next* between each text object. There's also the option to display a some text, erase it, and display some other text on the same slide. You can do this using *'alt*. Here's an excerpt from the demo I put together which which will hopefully clarify these concepts.
```
(slide
 #:title "What Does The Fox Say?"
 #:layout 'top
 'next
 'alts
 (list (list (item "*proceeds to kill, skin, and sell fox to native Cherokee indians*")
             'next
             (item "*feels bad*")
             'next
             (item "*becomes fox whisperer*"))
       (list (item "*marries cute, indpendent lady fox*")
             'next
             (item "*has family*")
             'next
             (item "*discovers that he once killed wife's father*"))
       (list (item (tt "*dies*")))
       (list (item (tt "*the fox says nothing*")))))
```
As you can see, my slide is formatted in *top* mode and has been given the title "What Does The Fox Say?" The *'next* keyword is what sequences the content. When the presenter hits the right arrow key, it will reveal the next part of the slide. The *'alts* keyword creates a somewhat complex seqeuence of text. It expects a list of lists and clears the screen after it's done outputting the current list. So if the screen currently says *becomes fox whisperer*, this means we're currently at the end of a list and that when the presenter hits next, the screen will be cleared and 'alt will enter the new list by printing *marries cute, indpendent lady fox*

Here are some screenshots of my output.






* a narrative of what you did
* highlights of code that you wrote, with explanation
* output from your code demonstrating what it produced
* at least one diagram or figure showing your work

The narrative itself should be no longer than 350 words. Yes, you need at least one image (output, diagrams). Images must be embedded into this md file. We should not have to click a link to see it. This is github, handling files is awesome and easy!

Code should be delivered in two ways:

1. Full files should be added to your version of this repository.
1. Key excerpts of your code should be copied into this .md file, formatted to look like code, and explained.

Ask questions publicly in the email group.

## How to Prepare and Submit this assignment

1. To start, [**fork** this repository][forking]. 
  2. (This assignment is just one README.md file, so you can edit it right in github)
1. Modify the README.md file and [**commit**][ref-commit] changes to complete your report.
1. Add your racket file to the repository. 
1. Ensure your changes (report in md file, and added rkt file) are committed to your forked repository.
1. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original repository to turn in the assignment.
